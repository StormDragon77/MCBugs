# MCBugs
Repository for tracking which Minecraft bugs I have fixed in my resource packs

These bugs are fixed in Stormilla, No Z-Fighting (Z-Fighting fixes only), and "Bug Squasher" (Yet to be released, fixes everything other than z-fighting)
I would like links to Mojira bug reports but it's not required. If you don't link it then give a good explanation of the bug. 

Still being set up, I need to reformat the fixes list
